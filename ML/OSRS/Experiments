Vary the number and size of layers

Check different targets
    For
        item
        index of items
            category
            of same item but different type (potions)
            top 100 most traded
            top 100 most expensive

    Regression
        Price
        Price Changes
        Price change in several days
        Moving Averages
    Classification
        Price up or down
        Price up a lot or price down a lot
        Start of long rise or start of long fall

    Check if these can be translated to buy/sell signals
        price changes obviously directly translate
            but can adjust based on size of the change
